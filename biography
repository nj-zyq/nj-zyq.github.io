Yiqing Zhou completed her Bachelor's degree at Nanjing University in 2018 and earned her Master's degree in 2021 from the Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
Her master's research focused on solving the Helmholtz equation using the finite element method. 
In 2022, Yiqing collaborated with Professor Daan Huybrechs at the Department of Computer Science, KU Leuven, on projects involving function approximation and solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using radial basis functions. 
Their work has been published in the Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics.

Since January 2023, Yiqing has been pursuing her PhD at KU Leuven under the supervision of Professor Dirk Nuyens. 
Her current research revolves around characterizing the input composition of recycled metals during the steelmaking process by statistical learning.
